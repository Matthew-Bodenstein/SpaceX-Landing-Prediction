🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the landing success of Falcon 9 boosters based on historical SpaceX launch data. The analysis considers key factors such as launch site, payload mass, orbit type, and booster reusability. The trained model achieves an impressive 94.4% accuracy, aiding in the optimization of rocket recovery and cost efficiency.

📊 Key Questions Explored

1. What is the overall success rate of Falcon 9 landings?

2. Which launch sites have the highest success rate?

3. Does payload mass affect the success of landings?

4. How has the landing success rate changed over time?

5. Are reused boosters more successful than new ones?

6. Can machine learning predict Falcon 9 landing success?

🎯 Goals

✔ Analyze Falcon 9 landing success rates across different conditions.✔ Visualize trends in landing outcomes using data analysis.✔ Develop a machine learning model to predict landing success.✔ Assess model performance and interpret findings for real-world applications.
